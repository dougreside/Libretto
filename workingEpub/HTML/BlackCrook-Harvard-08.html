Scene 2nd
</div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="idp462400">
A lobby in the castle of Wolfenstein (in 1) Enter Barbara R.H. followed by Carline.)
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_280">
<div class="speaker" id="idp463008">Barbara</div>
<div class="p" id="idp463280">
Don't talk to me, girl.  Remember your station and consider 
mine.  Who am I and what am I that I should be lodged in a 
wing of the castle overlooking the dog kennels?
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_281">
<div class="speaker" id="idp464176">Carline</div>
<div class="p" id="idp464432">
Your ladyship is quite right to rebel, and when I advised your 
ladyship to calm yourself it was out of consideration for 
your ladyship's eyes.  Any little flurry does so spoil the 
natural beauty of their expression.
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_282">
<div class="speaker" id="idp465376">Barbara</div>
<div class="p" id="idp465632">
Carline, you're a good girl, you're a considerate girl and I 
forgive you, but eyes or no eyes, I'll not be imposed on.
Where's Mynheer Von Puffengruntz?  Where's his Lordship's 
Chamberlain?
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_283">
<div class="speaker" id="idp466640">Carline</div>
<div class="p" id="idp466896">
<div class="inner_stage" id="idp467152">(Looking L.H.)</div>
Here he comes down the great stairway, as full of flesh and 
scant of breath as ever.
<div class="inner_stage" id="idp467632"> 
(Aside)</div>
And as the waddling old porpoise appears to have a liquorish 
tooth for this silly old buzzard, I'll leave them to bill and 
coo while I run off to comfort dear 'Mina who has passed the 
whole night in tears for poor Rodolphe.</div>
</div>
<div class="outer_stage" id="idp468752">
(Von Puff enters L.H.  CARLINE curtsies and exits L.H.)

<div class="sp" id="anch_284">
<div class="speaker" id="idp469328">Von Puff</div>
<div class="p" id="idp469584">
Eh, what, Madam Barbara, stirring so early!  Why, bless my 
soul, the mist of the mountain is yet hanging upon the turrets 
of the castle.
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_285">
<div class="speaker" id="idp470240">Barbara</div>
<div class="p" id="idp470512">
There let it hang and be hanged to it!  Stirring indeed!  Haven't 
I been stirring all night.  Has not her ladyship been stirring all night 
and wouldn't the seven sleepers have 
been stirring all night, too, if they had lodged where I did?
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_286">
<div class="speaker" id="idp471568">Von Puff</div>
<div class="p" id="idp471824">
Surely nothing has had the audacity to disturb <span class="deleted" id="idp472080">the quiet of 
your slumbers</span> <div class="added" id="idp472336">you</div>?
</div>

<div class="speaker" id="idp472976">Barbara</div>
<div class="p" id="idp473232">
Nothing!  To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of 
last night, nothing?  Why the thunder creashed over the castle 
loud enough to wake the dead.  That was bad enough, but only 
to think that I, the right honorable foster mother that <em id="idp473744">is</em> 
to be, to her right honorable ladyship that <em id="idp474416">is</em> to be, 
passing the night in apartments overlooking a dog kennel.
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_288">
<div class="speaker" id="idp475376">Von Puff</div>
<div class="p" id="idp475648">
A dog-kennel?
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_289">
<div class="speaker" id="idp476176">Barbara</div>
<div class="p" id="idp476448">
Aye, a kennel of great, savage hounds, fed late at night on 
raw meat by their one eyed keeper on purpose 
to give them the nightmare and make them 
dream all night long of chasing wild boars in the forest.  
Ugh!  I shall never get their horrible yelping out of my head.
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_290">
<div class="speaker" id="idp477248">Von Puff</div>
<div class="p" id="idp477520">
Believe me, my dear Madam Barbara, it is the first time the 
brutes ever were known to have been unruly.  I promise you that 
they shall be soundly punished and instantly removed.  But 
I too am criminal.  The apartments were selected by me because 
they command the best view of the mountains.
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_291">
<div class="speaker" id="idp478336">Barbara</div>
<div class="p" id="idp478608">
But I don't want to look at the mountains.  I got a glimpse 
of it from one of the North windows last night during the
storm, and it looked for all the world as if Beelzebub and his 
imps were holding a jubileee there.
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_292">
<div class="speaker" id="idp479520">Von Puff</div>
<div class="p" id="idp479776">
Enough, my dear Madam Barbara, enough.  If the mountain is 
unpleasant it shall be removed.  <div class="added" id="idp480128">No, no!  I mean you shall 
be removed.</div>
<div class="inner_stage" id="idp480560">(Approaching her in a wheedling manner)</div>
Will it please you to accompany me and choose for yourself?
</div>

<div class="speaker" id="idp481312">Barbara</div>
<div class="p" id="idp481568">
<div class="inner_stage" id="idp481824">
(Simperingly)</div>
Really, Mynheer Von Puffengruntz, you have such mollifying 
ways that--that--

<div class="p" id="idp483216">Oh! o-o.

<div class="speaker" id="idp483744">Barbara</div>

Would it be prudent?  Dare I trust myself?  We poor silly 
things are so weak and you men are so naughty that--that--

face and sighs)</div>

<div class="speaker" id="idp485120">Von Puff</div>
<div class="p" id="idp485392">
Confiding innocence, rely upon the honor of a Von Puffengruntz.
<div class="inner_stage" id="idp485728">(Looks around, sighs, kisses her.  She utters a 
faint scream and hiding her face 
in her fan is led off L.H. by Von Puffengruntz chuckling)</div>
