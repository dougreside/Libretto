Ill fortune, Amina! After reaching Gottingen,
and finding no purchaser for my picture, 
I heard that there was a wealthy traveller 
at Cassel, collecting works of art.  
I had but four silver florins in my 
pocket, yet I hopefully set out to meet 
him.  After journeying five whole days 
I arrived at Cassel, only to find that the 
traveller had departed two days before.
