What's the use?  Now what <em id="idp810432">is</em> the use?  The oftener I call,
the fainter comes the answer.  Here it is, quite dark, Master 
waiting for the horses and I wandering about like a Jack o' Lantern,
following the horn of some goblin huntsman.  There's 
some devil's work going on.  I know there's some devils work 
going on.

I beg his Infernal Majesty's pardon, I hope I haven't said 
anything to offend, but strange sights and sounds are in the 
air.  Birds that ought to have gone to roost an hour ago, fly 
screaming from tree to tree, the dismal screech-owl, from 
his hole in the oak answers to the croak of the dreary 
monk-raven and just now I saw a big fat buck scampering through 
the forest with his tail on fire.  Oh, dear, oh dear, what 
fearful omens.  And I'm to be married tomorrow.  If anything 
should happen to me--if my poor dear little Carline should 
happen to be left a widow before she's made a wife--if I 
should never taste--that is, if I should never know--Oh, 
lord, it won't bear thinking of  I'll try once more.
<div class="inner_stage" id="idp824192">(Winds the horn.  Echo without scarely audible)</div>
Worse and worse.  Oh lord, Oh Lord!  I want to go home.</div>
