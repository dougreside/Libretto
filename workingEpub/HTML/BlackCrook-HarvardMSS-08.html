A lobby in the castle of Wolfenstein in (1)--Enter 
Barbara RH., followed by Carline.

<div class="p" id="idp493520">
Don't talk to me, girl, remember your station and consider 
mine.  Who am I, and what am I, that I should be lodged in a 
wing of the castle overlooking the dog kennels.

<div class="speaker" id="idp494544">Carline</div>
<div class="p" id="idp494800">
Your ladyship is quite right to rebel, and when I advised your 
ladyship to calm yourself it was out of consideration for 
your ladyship's eyes.  Any little flurry does so spoil the 
natural beauty of their expression.

Carline, you're a good girl, you're a considerate girl and I 
forgive you, but eyes or no eyes, I'll not be imposed upon.
Where's Mynheer Von Puffengruntz?  Where's his Lordship's 
chamberlain?

Eh, what, Madam Barbara, stirring so early?  Why, bless my 
soul, the mist of the mountain is yet hanging upon the turrets 
of the castle.

I been stirring all night and wouldn't the seven sleepers have

Nothing?--To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of 
last night, nothing?  Why the thunder creashed over the castle 
loud enough to wake the dead!  That was bad enough, but only 
to think that I, the right honorable foster-mother that is 
to be to her right honorable ladyship that is to be passing 
the night in apartments overlooking a dog kennel.

<div class="sp" id="anch_289">
<div class="speaker" id="idp504976">Barbara</div>
<div class="p" id="idp505248">
Aye!--a kennel of great savage hounds, fed late at night on 
raw meat, by their one eyed keeper, on purpose to give them the night mare 
and make them dream all night long of chasing wild boars in the forest.  
Ugh!  I shall never get their terrible yelping out of my head.
</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_290">
<div class="speaker" id="idp506048">Puffengruntz</div>
<div class="p" id="idp506320">
Believe me, my dear Madam Barbara, it is the first time the 
brutes ever were known to have been unruly.  I promise that 
they shall be soundly punished and instantly removed.  But 
I too am criminal.  The apartments were selected by me because 
they command the best view of the mountain.

<div class="speaker" id="idp507136">Dame</div>
<div class="p" id="idp507408">
But I don't want to look at the mountain.  I got a glimpse 
of it from one of the North windows, last night, during the
storm, and it looked for all the world as if Belzebub and his 
imps were holding a jubilee there.

Enough, my dear Madam Barbara, enough.  If the mountain is 
unpleasant <div class="added" id="idp509024">&gt;it shall be removed.  No, no!  I mean </div>

Really, Mynheer Von Puffengruntz, you have such mollifying 
ways that--that--

Would it be prudent?  Dare I trust myself?  We poor silly
