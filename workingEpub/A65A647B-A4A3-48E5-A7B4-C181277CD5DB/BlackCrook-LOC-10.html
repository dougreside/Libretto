Scene IV.--The Grotto of Golden Stalactites.  A grand and  
comprehensive water-cavern of gold, deeply perspective,  
with stalacti-form arched roof.  Cut  
wings representing vistas running parallel  
and harmonizing with that of the main grotto,  
the mouth of which [5 feet high and 5 feet wide]  
discloses an open lake or bath and distant shore at  
back.  Set transparent silver waters, in which  
are seen sporting fishes and nondescript amphibea.  
Diminutive fairies asleep in the waters  
of the grotto in golden shells.  Set ground or  
shore piece richly studded with gold and jewels.   
Set masses of emerald and gold R. L. and C. upon  
and at the foot of which are reclining gnomes  
and amphibea.  Fairies asleep in poses R. and L. 
The moon--seen through opening at back and  
over the distant shore of the lake--shows red  
 at the opening of scene.  [Music at change. Shortly  
after which, Dragonfin, who has been asleep  
on a jewelled mass on the shore (C.), slowly awakens,  
rises, and stretches himself.  Upon turning  
he sees the red upon the face of the moon.  Music chord.]

stifling breath displace the purer air.  I saw its venomed

its deadly coil, it poised itself to strike, when suddenly a youth, a  
mortal, strangely present in that wild, wierd spot, seeing the

and fairies.  The whole scene brilliantly lighted. Tableaux and
