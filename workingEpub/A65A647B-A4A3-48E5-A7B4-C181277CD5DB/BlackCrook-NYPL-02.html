Scene 1st--	A quiet valley at the foot of
the Hartz Mountains.  Cottage of Dame Barbara
R. H.  3rd Ent. with practicable upper window 
and balcony.  Set tree beside cottage, at back 
Set arbor L.H.  3rd ent. Broken water and 
 rustic stone bridge or long rocky trail
piece with platform from R to L backed 
by an extended range of hills or mountain spurs
above which light clouds appear, 
illuminated by the reflected light 
of the moon.  Shortly after rise of curtain 
the moonbeams grow faint and the ruddy 
glow of the rising sun diffuses itself 
over the clouds and horizon.

Ill fortune, Amina.  After reaching Gottingen
and finding no purchaser for my picture 
I heard that there was a wealthy traveller 
at Cassel, collecting works of art.  
I had but four silver florins in my 
pocket yet I hopefully set out to meet 
him.  After journeying five whole days 
I arrived at Cassel only to find that the 
traveller had departed two days before.

No.  Crushed in my last hope to obtain

left it with a remorseless agent for a 
pittance barely sufficient for subsistence 
during my journey homeward, and here 
I am without a single guilder in my <div class="added" id="idp62016">pocket!</div> And what is worse if I fail to redeem

Be calm and listen.  Last week I attended 
the festival of St. John, in company 
with the other members of the village 
choir.  Upon raising my eyes after we 
had finished the anthem I found a 
dark, strange man gazing upon me.  
A moment after he quitted the spot 
I enquired who he was and learned that 
it was the Count Wolfenstein, the all
powerful lord of this wide domain.</div>
