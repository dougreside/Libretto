Don't talk to me, girl, remember <em id="idp418064">your</em> station and consider

Your ladyship is quite right to rebel, and when I advised your 
ladyship to calm yourself it was out of consideration for 
your ladyship's eyes.  Any little flurry does so spoil the

Carline, you're a good girl, you're a considerate girl and I

Eh, what!  Madam Barbara, stirring so early!  Why bless my

There let it hang and be hanged to it.  Stirring indeed!  Haven't 
I been stirring all night, and wouldn't the seven sleepers have 
been stirring all night too, if they had lodged where I did?

Nothing?  To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of 
last night <em id="idp428576">nothing</em>?  Why the thunder crashed over the castle 
loud enough to wake the dead.  That was <em id="idp429056">bad</em> enough, but only 
to think that I, the right honorable foster-mother that <em id="idp429520">is</em> 
to be to her right honorable ladyship that <em id="idp429952">is</em> to be passing 
the night in apartments overlooking a dog-kennel.

Aye, a kennel of great, savage hounds, fed late at night on 
raw meat on purpose to give them the night-mare and make them 
dream all night long of chasing wild boars in the forest,  
Ugh!  I shall never get their horrible yelping out of my head.

Believe me, my dear Madam Barbara, it is the first time the 
brutes ever were known to have been unruly, I promise that 
they shall be soundly punished and instantly removed.  But 
I too am criminal.  The apartments were selected by me because 
they command the best view of the mountain.

But I don't want to look at the mountain.  I got a glimpse 
of it from one of the north windows last night during the
storm and it looked for all the world like Be<div class="added" id="idp426576">e</div>lzebub and his

Enough, my dear Madam Barbara, enough.  If the mountain is 
unpleasant, it shall be removed.  No, no!  I mean <em id="idp435744">you</em> shall 
be removed.
