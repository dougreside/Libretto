What's the use?  Now what <em id="idp631568">is</em> the use?  The oftener I call  
the fainter comes the answer.  Here it is quite dark. Master  
waiting for the horses and I wandering about like a jack o' lantern, 
following the horn of some goblin huntsman.  There's  
some devil's work going on.

I beg his infernal Majesty's pardon. I hope I have not said  
anything to offend ; but strange sights and sounds are in the  
air.  Birds that ought to have been to roost an hour ago, fly  
screaming from tree to tree.  The dismal screech-owl, from  
its hole in the oak, answers to the croak of the dreary  
monk-raven ; and just now I saw a big fat buck scampering through  
the forest with his tail on fire.  Oh dear! Oh dear! what  
fearful omens!  And I'm to be married to-morrow.  If anything  
should happen to me!  If my poor, dear, darling little Carline should  
happen to be left a widow before she's made a wife--if I  
should never taste--that is, if I should never know--Oh,  
Lord! it won't bear thinking of.  I'll try once more. 
<div class="inner_stage" id="idp631952">[Minds the horn.  Echo scarce audible.]</div> 
Worse and worse.  Oh Lord! Oh Lord!  I want to go home!
