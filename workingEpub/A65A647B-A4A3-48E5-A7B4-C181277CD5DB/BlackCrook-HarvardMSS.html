<div class="added" id="idp54576">Ill fortune, Amina. </div> After reaching Gottingen
and finding no purchaser for my picture 
I heard that there was a wealthy traveller 
at Cassel, collecting works of art.  
I had but four silver florins in my 
pocket yet I hopefully set out to meet 
him.  After journeying five whole days 
I arrived at Cassel only to find that the 
traveller had departed two days before.

<div class="speaker" id="idp55600">Amina</div>

</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_28">
<div class="speaker" id="idp56496">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p" id="idp56768">
No.  Crushed in my last hope to obtain 
the means necessary to our union I 
left it with a remorseless agent for a 
pittance barely sufficient for subsistence 
during my journey homeward, and here 
I am without a single guilder in my pocket! And what is worse if I fail to redeem 
my pledge at the end of two months it 
is lost to me forever.</div>

<div class="p" id="idp61440">
Be calm and listen.  Last week I attended 
the festival of St. John, in company 
with the other members of the village 
choir.  Upon raising my eyes after we 
had finished the anthem I found a 
<div class="added" id="idp61904">dark,</div> strange, <span class="deleted" id="idp62320">dark</span>  man gazing upon me.  
A moment after he quitted the spot 
I enquired who he was and learned that 
it was the Count Wolfenstein, the all
powerful lord of this wide domain.</div>
</div>
<div class="sp" id="anch_32">
<div class="speaker" id="idp63152">Rodolphe</div>

Well?</div>

<div class="speaker" id="idp63952">Amina</div>

Although I met his gaze but for a moment, 
I felt that it boded evil to me--to us.</div>

<div class="speaker" id="idp64832">Rodolphe</div>
<div class="p" id="idp65104">

<div class="speaker" id="idp65648">Amina</div>
<div class="p" id="idp65920">
Yes, evil, Rodolphe, nor were my fears 
idle. The next day brought him here to 
our humble abode--he told my foster-
mother that he loved me.</div>

<div class="speaker" id="idp67776">Amina</div>
<div class="p" id="idp68048">
Yes, and that we should no longer dwell in 
obscurity, that we should be removed to the 
castle, that masters should be provided for 
my suitable education, and in a year 
I should take the place of the late Countess 
of Wolfenstein.</div>
