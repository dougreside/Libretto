the Hartz Mountains.  Cottage of Dame Barbara

and balcony.  Set tree beside cottage, at back 
Set arbor L.H.  3rd ent. Broken water and 
low rustic stone bridge or long rocky trail
piece, with platform from R. to L. backed 
by an extended range of hills or mountain spurs

illuminated by the reflected light 
of the moon.  Shortly after rise of curtains the moonbeams grow faint and the ruddy 
glow of the rising sun diffuses itself over the clouds and horizon.
