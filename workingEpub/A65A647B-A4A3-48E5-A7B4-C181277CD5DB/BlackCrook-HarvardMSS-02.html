and finding no purchaser for my picture 
I heard that there was a wealthy traveller 
at Cassel, collecting works of art.  
I had but four silver florins in my

him.  After journeying five whole days 
I arrived at Cassel only to find that the 
traveller had departed two days before.

No.  Crushed in my last hope to obtain 
the means necessary to our union I 
left it with a remorseless agent for a 
pittance barely sufficient for subsistence 
during my journey homeward, and here 
I am without a single guilder in my pocket! And what is worse if I fail to redeem

is lost to me forever.</div>

Be calm and listen.  Last week I attended 
the festival of St. John, in company 
with the other members of the village 
choir.  Upon raising my eyes after we 
had finished the anthem I found a

A moment after he quitted the spot 
I enquired who he was and learned that 
it was the Count Wolfenstein, the all
powerful lord of this wide domain.</div>

Yes, evil, Rodolphe, nor were my fears

Yes, and that we should no longer dwell in
