Don't talk to me, girl, remember your station and consider  
mine.  Who am I and what am I that I should be lodged in a  
wing of the castle overlooking the dog kennels.

Your ladyship is quite right to rebel, and when I advised your  
ladyship to calm yourself, it was out of consideration for  
your ladyships eyes--any little flurry does so spoil the  
natural beauty of their expression.

Eh! what!  madam Barbara, stirring so early?  Why, bless my  
soul, the mist of the mountain is yet hanging upon the turrets  
of the castle.

Then let it hang, and be hanged to it!  Stirring, indeed!  Havn't  
I been stirring all night? Hasn't her ladyship been stirring  
all night, and wouldn't the Seven Sleepers have  
been stirring all night, too, if they had lodged where I did?

<div class="p" id="idp409072"> 
Nothing! To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of  
last night nothing?  Why, the thunder creashed over the castle  
loud enough to wake the dead.  That was bad enough, but only  
to think that I, the right honorable foster-mother that <em id="idp409584">is</em>  
to be, to her right honorable ladyship that <em id="idp409968">is</em> to be, passing  
the night in apartments overlooking a dog-kennel.

<div class="p" id="idp411680"> 
Aye, a kennel of great, savage hounds, fed late at night with  
raw meat by their one-eyed keeper, on purpose to give them the night-mare  
and make them  
dream all night long of chasing wild boars in the forest.   
Ugh!  I shall never get their horrible yelping out of my head.

<div class="p" id="idp412752"> 
Believe me, my dear Madam Barbara, it is the first time the  
brutes were ever known to have been unruly.  I promise you that  
they shall be soundly punished and instantly removed.  But  
I, too, am criminal.  The apartments were selected by me because  
they commanded the best view of the mountain.

<div class="speaker" id="idp413584">Bar.</div>
<div class="p" id="idp413856"> 
But I don't want to look at the mountain.  I got a glimpse  
of it from one of the north windows last night during the 
storm, and it looked for all the world as if Belzebub and his  
imps were holding a jubileee there.

Enough, my dear Madam Barbara, enough! If the mountain is  
unpleasant, it shall be removed.  No, no, I--I mean <em id="idp415408">you</em> shall  
be removed.
