<div class="outer_stage" id="idp502384">
The Grotto of Golden Stalactites--A grand and
comprehensive water cavern of gold, deeply perspective, 
with Stalactiform arched roof, cut 
wings, representing vistas, running parallel 
and harmonizing with that of the main grotto, 
the mouth of which (5 feet high by 5 feet wide) 
discloses an open lake and distant shore at 
back.  Set transparent silver waters, in which 
are seen sporting fishes and nondescript Amphibea. 
Diminutive fairies asleep on the waters 
of the grotto in golden shells.  Set ground or 
shore-piece richly studded with gold and jewels.  
Set masses of emerald and gold R, L, + C., upon 
and at the foot of which are reclining Gnomes 
and Amphibea.  Fairies asleep in poses R + L.
The Moon, seen through the opening at the back and 
over the distant shore of the lake, shows red 
upon its face at the opening of the scene.

<div class="outer_stage" id="idp503632">Music at change.  Shortly
