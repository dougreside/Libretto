<P><br/><B>Introduction to <I>The Black Crook</I></B></P>
<P><I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">was not
the first American musical. No musical theater historian in the last
hundred years seems ever to have seriously argued that it was
(although many seem to believe everyone else has wrongly identified
it to be so). When discussing the piece in his seminal 1950 history,
“Musical Comedy in America” Cecil Smith wrote:</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The popular musical stage in the
United States reached major dimensions for the first time on the
vening of September 12, 1866, when the curtain of Niblo's Garden, on
the corner of Boradway and Prince Street in New York, rose on the
opening performance of </SPAN><I>The Black Crook. </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Not
that </SPAN><I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">was,
as has frequently been claimed, the “first musical comedy.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
</SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Nearly a decade later David Evans wrote
in the introduction to his “The Complete Book of the American
Musical”:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.51in; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Since </SPAN><I>The Black Crook
</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(1866) was the first American
musical production in which there could be detected some of the
ritual that the American musical theater would subsequently pursue,
it is often singled out as our first musical comedy. But musical
productions of other varieties had existed in this country long
before </SPAN><I>The Black Crook.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></I></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">In an article in </SPAN><I>Theatre
Survey </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">titled “</SPAN><I>The
Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Myth,”</SPAN>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">published at the centenary of the
show</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">in 1966, Julian Mates
cites Smith and Ewen as evidence that “The year 1866, with its
production of </SPAN><I>The Black Crook, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">has
been accepted as the landmark indicating the beginnings of the
American musical comedy.” He then goes on to demonstrate that
“nothing about </SPAN><I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">justifies
its position as the precursor of our modern lyric stage; all its
forms and conventions derive from a long tradition established well
before 1866.”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SPAN>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Every decade or so another history
of the musical comes out, and almost every historian feels compelled
to discuss the show at some length while at the same time observing
that, whatever their less enlightened colleagues may have thought, it
was in no way the “First American Musical.” </SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">It is not entirely clear why so
many historians have believed that their colleagues (or perhaps the
public) think that </SPAN><I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">was
the first musical. Perhaps it was an off-hand comment by theater
manager Michael Bennett Leavitt, who, in his 1912 memoir, did claim
</SPAN><I>The Black Crook </I>“<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">was
really the birth of all the ballets, burlesques, comic operas, and
musical comedy of the present day.”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
Its possible Leavitt's claim still represented the popular view forty
years later when Cecil Smith wrote his history of the musical, but I
suspect his memory was refreshed by a 1945 article in the journal
</SPAN><I>Dance Index </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">by the
first curator of the Theater Collection at NYPL, George Freedley, who
did not call it </SPAN><I>The Black Crook</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">first,
but did claim that “Thanks to the enormous publicity it received
eighty years ago and the handsome Hoboken revival fifteen years ago,
this is the </SPAN><I>one </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">musical
of which even untutored audiences have heard”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
(4) The Hoboken production, produced in 1929 by critic and writer
Christopher Moreley with choreography by Agnes De Mille, opened just
two years after Florenz Ziegfeld had produced </SPAN><I>Show Boat </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">on
Broadway. The New Jersey production may have served to remind
audiences and critics that there once existed another grand musical
spectacle that resembled one of Ziegfelds famous </SPAN><I>Follies
</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">with its fantastic scenery and
scantily clad female dancers, but which also had something like a
serious and tragic dramatic through-line (however silly). Two
articles in the </SPAN><I>New York Times, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">in
fact, compared the women in the production to those in a Ziegfeld
chorus. By the 1950s, when the first long-form histories of the
modern American musical were being written, the form had come to be
defined largely by the models created by Rodgers and Hammerstein
beginning with </SPAN><I>Oklahoma </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(which
also featured DeMille choreography) and presaged by </SPAN><I>Show
Boat</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">. Perhaps Morley's
production reminded audiences that </SPAN><I>Show Boat </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">itself
grew out of a tradition that included </SPAN><I>The Black Crook, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and</SPAN>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">writers twenty years later still
thought of 19</SPAN><SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">th</SPAN></SUP>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">century piece as the earliest
dramatic piece of its kind that came easily to mind.</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Still, the caveats of
a chorus of musical theater historians are correct: </SPAN><I>The
Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">was not the first
musical (at least in the way the genre is popularly defined today).
The score changed frequently—not only from production to production
but even in the course of the original run. The music, dances, and
songs were swapped out for others as the cast changed or when the
producers felt the program needed to be refreshed. An 1892 piece in
the </SPAN><I>New York Times</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">noted
that a “'variety show' was introduced in the third act of the
spectacle sometime in the seventies” [September 2, 1892], which
explains why later programs promise acts by the trapeze artists such
as the “Kiralfy Brothers” (1886) or, in the fourth production in
the 1870s--“Mr. Felix Regamey, the Great Caricaturist.” </SPAN>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Certainly, it seems
author, Charles Barras, did not intend for the production to include
so many diversions from his plot. The author of an 1885 piece in the
</SPAN><I>New York Sun </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">recalls
that Barras “fairly cried out aloud when his labored and
sophomorical dialogue was cut out by the page in reducing his play to
a spectacle.” [December 20] The play had been licensed, however,
for exactly the purpose of, in the words of box office manager Joseph
Whitton, “a clothes-lines on which to hang the pretty dresses.”
In the early summer of 1866 impressarios Henry Jarrett and Harry
Palmer had joined with William Wheatley, manager of the Niblo's
Garden Theater, to look for a play that could accommodate the ballet
dancers and scenery the pair had engaged on a tour of Europe in the
winter of 1865-1866.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
Jarrett and Palmer had originally planned to find speciality acts for
a production of Undine they planned to stage at the Academy of Music,
but during their trip it seems they had been so impressed by a
Parisian staging of </SPAN><I>La Biche Au Bois </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">they
had decided to produce it instead. Neither was to be, however, for
the Academy of Music burned down in May of 1866, just as the pair
returned from Europe. They went to Wheatley with the idea of
producing the public domain opera, “The Naiad Queen” at Niblo's
Garden, but the manager objected on the grounds that if it were a
success “every concert saloon in New York” would stage their own
competing productions<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A>.
The trio agreed to look for an appropriate piece for which they could
obtain an exclusive license and found one several days later when
theater manager, Leonard Grover, suggested Wheatley consider a new
play by Barras for his purposes.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
Wheatley was convinced, and though Jarrett and Palmer initially
balked at the royalty fee Barras demanded (suggesting, instead, that
they commission a new play by manager and playwright Augustin Daly),
they eventually agreed to Barras's terms.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="#sdfootnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
</SPAN>
</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="font-style: normal">Once the rights were
obtained, the producers immediately began to look for moments into
which to insert dance and spectacle. The text provided many such
opportunities. The Harvard Manuscript copy includes four passages
laid out as verse: The choral procession that closes the first scene
(“Hark! Hark! Hark!”), the Incantation, and the chorus of Gnomes,
Amphibea, and Fairies, and Stalacta's looking-glass spell). Further,
in the first scene song in the fourth scene of the first act, there
is an obvious song cue when the chamber maid, Carline, concludes a
monologue saying “I'm so happy I could sing for a month” and
Stalacta is directed to sing a song to announce her entrance. There
are also many instructions in the stage directions that call for
dances. The villagers enter dancing in the first scene and soon after
decide to practice their “festival dance” (which is described as
a “Garland Dance”). A dance by the water fairies commanded by
their Queen in honor of her birthday and two more later in the scene
commanded for the entertainment of Rodolphe and Greppo (the latter of
which is described as “grotesque”). The stage directions at the
opening of Act Four (Count Wolfenstein's birthday ball) calls for a
dance at a masked ball. Finally, the play ends with a “transformation
scene” that features a march by the Amazons.

<P ALIGN=LEFT><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">These moments,
although imagined by Barras, seem to have been greatly expanded in
the original production (references to dance throughout his
manuscript copy are emended to refer specifically to full ballet
performances). When the first performance lasted for over five hours,
it was clear cuts had to be made, and that they could not come from
the dance or spectacle but from the text. Barras may have objected,
but all of the reviews confirmed that the text was the most
disposable element of the piece. Authorized by the initial popular
appreciation of the spectacle and critical dismissal of the text,
later productions interpolated acts even less relevant to Barras's
plot. </SPAN><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">When

</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Nevertheless, despite the
frequent changes in the music, the basic script seems to have
remained remarkably consistent (at least while the show was performed
in the United States). Indeed, a writer for the </SPAN><I>New York
Times </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">mocked Wheatley for
changing the ballet while leaving the text, which the reporter
clearly thought inferior, untouched (28 May 1867). Scripts now held
by the Library of Congress and used in Federal Theater Project
productions in the 1930s are almost identical to Charles Barras's
draft manuscript preserved in the Harvard Theater Collection. </SPAN><I>The
Black Crook</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">may have been
somewhat innovative, then, in bringing variety into a American
theater filled with an audience prepared to listen to a play.
Certainly this was the opinion of the author of </SPAN><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">an
unsigned March 28, 1874 article in the New York Times, the journalist
argued that The Black Crook, “being called a drama, gave an excuse
to see a variety performance, against which a ridiculous prejudice
had long existed.”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P><I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and
several of the American musical theater pieces that followed (</SPAN><I>A
Trip to Chinatown</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and L. Frank
Baum's 1903 adaptation of his</SPAN> <I>Wizard of Oz </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">for
example) created spaces for a wide variety of musical styles to be
performed within productions with with relatively fixed scripts
(somewhat legitimizing the pieces as drama). Most earlier forms of
American music theater did not permit such an ecclectic mix of music
to be connected to a single plot. The scores of comic operas and
operetta were intended to be coherent musical pieces and the music
therefore had to be more or less of a piece. Even </SPAN><I>The
Beggars Opera, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">which a century
and a half before had interpolated popular songs into a stable text,
did not permit such a wide range of musical styles as </SPAN><I>The
Black Crook.</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">By the time the
scores of the American musical began to solidify again in the second
and third decades of the 20th century, the genre permitted an
increasingly wide array of possible styles for songs. </SPAN><I>Show
Boat </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">could therefore include a
pastiche of African-American spiritual in “Old Man River” and the
European-flavored “Life Upon the Wicked Stage.” For this reason,
it may not be so ridiculous to start the story of the American
musical with </SPAN><I>Black Crook,</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">after
all. </SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal"><br/><B>Introduction to the variorum edition</B></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">This edition preserves the five
extant 19</SPAN><SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">th</SPAN></SUP>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">century copies of the Barras's text:
a manuscript in Barras's hand (preserved in four notebooks at the
Harvard Theater Collection and as photocopies at the Harry K. Ransom
Center at the University of Texas-Austin), three 19</SPAN><SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">th</SPAN></SUP>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">century manuscript prompt books held
by the Harvard Theater Collection, New York Public Library, the
Hampden-Booth Theater Library at the Player's Club, and a small,
printed edition published in Chicago in 1867 and now held by the
Library of Congress. It does not include Myron Matlaw's 1967 edition
(published in his anthology </SPAN><I>The Black Crook and Other
Nineteenth Century American Plays</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">),
typescripts of productions performed for the Federal Theater Project
during the depression, or the two typescripts, seeming created by the
staff of New York Public Library (one of which was micro-formed and
disseminated as part of the Nineteenth Century American Drama
series). These copies appears to be mid-twentieth century transcripts
of an 1866 edition published in Buffalo, but may in fact simply be
edited transcripts of the promptbook in the collection (which, like
the other 19</SPAN><SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">th</SPAN></SUP>
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">century promptbooks, has the title
and copyright page from the Buffalo printing pasted onto its first
pages). This edition also excludes any copies of the London libretto
which has nothing but the title in common with Charles Barras's play.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Of the versions included in this
variorum edition, The Harvard Theater Collection manuscript is likely
the earliest. It is dated 1862 on the title page, although the “2”
appears to have been written over an earlier number, leading Craig
Bowley<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote10anc" HREF="#sdfootnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
to propose in his 1975 master's thesis that Barras may have backdated
the piece to avoid accusations of plagiarizing other similar works.
Instructions to “return to Mr. Barras” are written on the front
the start of each folio, and manuscript emendations to the text
suggest changes made during reheasrals (e.g. references to a bridge
in the first scene are struck, likely as result of a set design that
differed slightly from the one Barras initially imagined). The second
earliest copy is probably also held by Harvard, and seems to
represent a prompt book for the original production (it includes,
among the end papers, a receipt for $100 paid by Charles Barras to
John Holloway and dated October 2, 1866 for “composing + arranging
orchestra parts for “The Black Crook”). The prompt copy held by
NYPL is also likely an early one produced by the same copyist who
produced the Harvard prompt copy (the handwriting and paper are very
similar in both). The prompt copy at the Hampden-Booth Theater
library may also have been produced by the same copyist, but appears
to have been used in an 1867 tour of the Midwest (there are scene
timings for an July 24, 1867 stop at the Metropolitan Theater in
Indianapolis and a signature by a prompter, P.C. Nagen who used the
book in Chicago in 1869. As noted above, all three promptbooks have
pasted onto their first page a printed copy of the copyright notice
and title page from the no-longer-extant 1866 Buffalo printing which
may have predated the original production at Niblos. This title page
resembles the typeface and format of the Chicago edition so closely
as to suggest that the Chicago edition was essentially a reprint of
the Buffalo version with the cuts made for the various productions
excised (and seemingly relatively hastily--the scene numbering in the
Chicago edition drops Act 4, Scene 7 from the promptbooks, but rather
than renumber the scenes skips directly from Scene 6 to Scene 8 in
the fourth act). 
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">This digital edition also
features new recordings and sheet music for eight pieces of music
published in the late 1860s which were marketed as featuring music
from the 1866 production of </SPAN><I>The Black Crook</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">.
With the exception of </SPAN><I>You Naughty, Naughty Men,</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">none
of these pieces likely represent anything like the piano-vocal score
used in the production. They are, rather, short arrangements to be
played at home featuring some of the melodies audience may have heard
during the original production. The Black Crook Waltz, for instance,
includes a note above a few bars that the melody is Stalacta's song
“The Power of Love,” but this is likely just a brief excerpt of
the full melody which is now lost. Any attempt to place any fragment
of the rest of the published pieces into the action of the play is
mostly guess work, but I have tried to find moments where the music
fits the spirit of the moment even if audiences at Niblo's Garden
would likely have heard something different. My rationale for the
placement, admittedly very hypothetical in some cases, for each
placement is below.</SPAN></P>

David Costa is credited with the “Pas De Demon” on the program,
and although he is usually credited on sheet music for pieces with
which he was connected, he is not mentioned on the published music
for The Black Crook Galop. Further he is not mentioned on the program
in connection with the Pas De Sabot (or a “Dance of the Wooden
Shoes”). The pounding rhythm of this Galop suggests it might fit a
“Pas De Sabot.” Further, it is almost possible to set the lyrics
of the Villagers chorus (“Hark! Hark! Hark!”) to this music if
the lyric “Hark the birds with tuneful voices” begins on the
fifth measure. In the program the “Pas de Sabot” is listed before
the “Pas De Fleurs” (which would put it too early for the
Villager's chorus). However, it seems possible that it accompanied
the Villagers' entrance and then was reprised with lyrics on their
exit. It is also suggestive, though by no means conclusive proof of a
change from the order in the program, that the New York Times critic
mentions the Pas de Sabot after the Pas de Fleur in his synopsis of
the play.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A>

perform a “characteristic march.” Perhaps this was the Fairy
Queen March.</SPAN></SPAN>
