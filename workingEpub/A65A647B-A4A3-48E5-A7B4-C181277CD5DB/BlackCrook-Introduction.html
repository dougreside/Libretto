<div class="p"><B>Introduction to <I>The Black Crook</I></B></div> 
<div class="p"><BR> 
</div> 
<P>Since 1950, very few musical theater historians have seriously 
argued that the <I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">was 
this the first American musical. Also since 1950, many seem to 
believe everyone else wrongly believes it was. When discussing the 
piece in his seminal 1950 history, “Musical Comedy in America” 
Cecil Smith wrote:</SPAN></div> 
<div  STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The popular musical stage in the 
United States reached major dimensions for the first time on the 
evening of September 12, 1866, when the curtain of Niblo's Garden, on 
the corner of Boradway and Prince Street in New York, rose on the 
opening performance of </SPAN><I>The Black Crook. </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Not 
that </SPAN><I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">was, 
as has frequently been claimed, the “first musical comedy.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>

<div class="p"><BR>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Nearly a decade later David Evans 
wrote in the introduction to his “The Complete Book of the American 
Musical”:</SPAN>  
</div> 
<div class="p" STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Since </SPAN><I>The Black Crook 
</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(1866) was the first American 
musical production in which there could be detected some of the 
ritual that the American musical theater would subsequently pursue, 
it is often singled out as our first musical comedy. But musical 
productions of other varieties had existed in this country long 
before </SPAN><I>The Black Crook.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></I> 
</div> 
<div class="p"><BR> 
</div> 
<div class="p">In 
“<I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Myth,”</SPAN> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">published during </SPAN><I>The Black 
Crook's</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> centenary in 1966, 
Julian Mates cites Smith and Ewen as evidence that “The year 1866, 
with its production of </SPAN><I>The Black Crook, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">has 
been accepted as the landmark indicating the beginnings of the 
American musical comedy.” He then goes on to demonstrate that 
“nothing about </SPAN><I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">justifies 
its position as the precursor of our modern lyric stage; all its 
forms and conventions derive from a long tradition established well 
before 1866.”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SPAN> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Every decade or so another history 
of the musical comes out, and almost every historian feels compelled 
to discuss the show at some length while at the same time observing 
that, whatever their less enlightened colleagues may have thought, it 
was in no way the “First American Musical.” </SPAN> 
</div> 
<div class="p"><BR> 
</div> 
<div class="p"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The 
only historian I have found who unabashedly claim that </SPAN><I>The 
Black Crook</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> was the first of 
its&#39; kind was is 19th century theater manager Michael Bennett 
Leavitt, who, in his 1912 memoir, wrote </SPAN><I>The Black Crook 
</I>“<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">was really the birth of all 
the ballets, burlesques, comic operas, and musical comedy of the 
present day.”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A> 
Its possible Leavitt's claim still represented the popular view forty 
years later when Cecil Smith wrote his history of the musical, but I 
suspect Smith's memory was refreshed by a 1945 article in the journal 
</SPAN><I>Dance Index </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">by the 
first curator of the Theater Collection at NYPL, George Freedley, who 
did not call </SPAN><I>The Black Crook</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">first, 
but did claim that “Thanks to the enormous publicity it received 
eighty years ago and the handsome Hoboken revival fifteen years ago, 
this is the </SPAN><I>one </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">musical 
of which even untutored audiences have heard”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SPAN></div> 
<div class="p"><BR> 
</div> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The Hoboken production to which 
Freedley refers was, produced in 1929 by critic and writer 
Christopher Moreley with choreography by Agnes De Mille and opened 
just two years after Florenz Ziegfeld had produced </SPAN><I>Show 
Boat </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">on Broadway. The New Jersey 
production may have served to remind audiences and critics that there 
once existed another grand musical spectacle that resembled one of 
Ziegfelds famous </SPAN><I>Follies </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">with 
its fantastic scenery and scantily clad female dancers, but which 
also had something like a plot. Two articles in the </SPAN><I>New 
York Times, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">in fact, compared 
the women in the Hoboken production to those in a Ziegfeld chorus. By 
the 1950s, when the first long-form histories of the modern American 
musical were being written, the musical had come to be largely 
defined by the model created by Rodgers and Hammerstein beginning 
with </SPAN><I>Oklahoma </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(which 
also featured Agnes De Mille choreography) and presaged by </SPAN><I>Show 
Boat</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">. Perhaps Morley's 
production reminded audiences that </SPAN><I>Show Boat </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">itself 
grew out of a tradition that included </SPAN><I>The Black Crook, </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">and 
believed Leavitt's</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> 
claim that it was the earliest of its kind.</SPAN></div> 
<div class="p"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Still, the caveats of 
a chorus of musical theater historians are correct: </SPAN><I>The 
Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">was not the first 
musical (at least in the way the genre is popularly defined today). 
The score changed frequently—not only from production to production 
but even in the course of the original run. The music, dances, and 
songs were swapped out for others as the cast changed or when the 
producers felt the program needed to be refreshed. An 1892 piece in 
the </SPAN><I>New York Times</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">noted 
that a “'variety show' was introduced in the third act of the 
spectacle sometime in the seventies”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A>, 
which explains why later programs promise acts by the trapeze artists 
such as the “Kiralfy Brothers” (1886) or, in the fourth 
production in the 1870s--“Mr. Felix Regamey, the Great 
Caricaturist.”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A> 
</SPAN> 
</div> 
<div class="p"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Certainly, it seems 
author, Charles Barras, did not intend for the production to include 
so many diversions from his plot. The author of an 1885 piece in the 
</SPAN><I>New York Sun </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">recalls 
that Barras “fairly cried out aloud when his labored and 
sophomorical dialogue was cut out by the page in reducing his play to 
a spectacle.”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A> 
The play had been licensed, however, for exactly the purpose of, in 
the words of box office manager Joseph Whitton, “a clothes-lines on 
which to hang the pretty dresses.”<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="#sdfootnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A> 
In the early summer of 1866 impressarios Henry Jarrett and Harry 
Palmer had joined with William Wheatley, manager of the Niblo's 
Garden Theater, to look for a play that could accommodate the ballet 
dancers and scenery the pair had engaged on a tour of Europe in the 
winter of 1865-1866.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote10anc" HREF="#sdfootnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A> 
Jarrett and Palmer had originally planned to use the speciality acts 
in a production of </SPAN><I>Undine</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> 
they planned to stage at the Academy of Music, but during their trip 
it seems they had been so impressed by a Parisian staging of </SPAN><I>La 
Biche Au Bois </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">they had decided 
to produce it instead. Neither was to be, however, for the Academy of 
Music burned down in May of 1866, just as the pair returned from 
Europe. They went to Wheatley with the idea of producing the public 
domain opera, “The Naiad Queen” at Niblo's Garden, but the 
manager objected on the grounds that if it were a success “every 
concert saloon in New York” would stage their own competing 
productions<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A>. 
The trio agreed to look for an appropriate piece for which they could 
obtain an exclusive license and found one several days later when 
theater manager, Leonard Grover, suggested Wheatley consider a new 
play by Barras for his purposes.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote12anc" HREF="#sdfootnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A> 
Wheatley was convinced, and though Jarrett and Palmer initially 
balked at the fee Barras demanded (feeling that for less money they 
could commission a new play by fellow manager and playwright Augustin 
Daly), they eventually agreed to Barras's terms.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A> 
</SPAN> 
</div> 
<div class="p">Once the rights were 
obtained, the producers immediately began to look for moments into 
which to insert dance and spectacle. The text provided many such 
opportunities. The Harvard Manuscript copy includes four passages 
laid out as verse: The choral procession that closes the first scene 
(“Hark! Hark! Hark!”), the Incantation, the chorus of Fairies, 
and Stalacta's looking-glass spell). Further, in the fourth scene of 
the first act, there is an obvious song cue when the chamber maid, 
Carline, concludes a monologue saying “I'm so happy I could sing 
for a month” and Stalacta is directed to sing a song to announce 
her entrance. More importantly given the talent Jarret and Palmer had 
hired in Europe, there are also many moments in the text that call 
for dance. In the first scene, the villagers decide to practice their 
“festival dance” (described as a “Garland Dance” in the stage 
directions). The Fairy Queen Stalacta commands a dance by the water 
fairies in honor of her birthday and later in the scene a “grotesque 
dance” is commanded for the entertainment of Rodolphe and Greppo. 
The stage directions at the opening of Act Four (Count Wolfenstein's 
birthday ball) calls for a dance at a masked ball. Finally, the play 
ends with a “transformation scene” that features a march by the 
Amazons.  
</div> 
<div class="p"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">These 
moments can be mapped without much difficulty onto the acts described 
in the opening night program:</SPAN>  
</div><br/> 
<ul>
<li>
Pas de Sabot/Pas de Fleurs ....Garland Dance/Exit of chorus  
</li>
		<li>Song: Naughty, Naughty Man....Carline's song  </li>
		<li>Grand Incantation....Hertzog's Summoning Incantation  
			</li> 
		<li>Pas de Naide....Stalacta's birthday dance</li> 
		<li>Pas de Demon....Grotesque dance  
			</li> 
		<li>Bal Masque/Pas Espanoil/Pas Hongroise....Dance at the ball</li> 
		<li>Dance de Amazons....Rescue of Rudolphe by Stalacta's army in scene 4</li> 
		<li>Transformation Scene....Transformation in scene 7 and 8  
			</li> 
		</ul>
<div class="p"><BR> 
</div> 
<div class="p"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">These 
moments, although imagined by Barras, seem to have been greatly 
expanded in the original production (references to dance throughout 
his manuscript copy are emended to refer specifically to full ballet 
performances). </SPAN> 
</div> 
<div class="p"><BR> 
</div> 
<div class="p"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">When 
the first performance lasted for over five hours, it was clear cuts 
had to be made.  Barras may have objected, but all of the reviews 
confirmed that the text was the most disposable element of the piece. 
Authorized by the initial popular appreciation of the spectacle and 
critical dismissal of the text, later productions interpolated acts 
even less relevant to Barras's plot (and deletions in the prompt 
books suggest entire scenes of Barras's script were sometimes 
dropped). </SPAN><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">When

<div class="p"><BR> 
</div> 
<div class="p"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Nevertheless, 
despite frequent changes in the music, the script used as a starting 
point seems to have remained remarkably consistent (at least while 
the show was performed in the United States). Indeed, a writer for 
the </SPAN><I>New York Times </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">mocked 
Wheatley for changing the ballet while leaving the text, which the 
reporter clearly thought inferior, untouched (28 May 1867). Twentieth 
entury Scripts now held by the Library of Congress and used in 
Federal Theater Project productions in the 1930s are almost identical 
to Charles Barras's draft manuscript preserved in the Harvard Theater 
Collection. </SPAN><I>The Black Crook</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">may 
have been somewhat innovative, then, in bringing variety into a 
American theater filled with an audience prepared to listen to a 
play. Certainly this was the opinion of the author of </SPAN><FONT FACE="Cambria"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">an 
unsigned March 28, 1874 article in the New York Times, the journalist 
argued that The Black Crook, “being called a drama, gave an excuse 
to see a variety performance, against which a ridiculous prejudice 
had long existed.”</SPAN></FONT></FONT></div> 
<div class="p"><BR> 
</div> 
<P><I>The Black Crook </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and 
several of the American musical theater pieces that followed (</SPAN><I>A 
Trip to Chinatown</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">and L. Frank 
Baum's 1903 adaptation of his</SPAN> <I>Wizard of Oz </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">for 
example) created spaces for a wide variety of musical styles to be 
performed within productions with with relatively fixed scripts 
(somewhat legitimizing the extravaganzas as drama). Most earlier 
forms of American music theater did not permit such an eclectic mix 
of music to be connected to a single plot:  the scores of comic 
operas and operetta are intended to be coherent musical pieces and 
the music therefore had to be more or less of a piece and even </SPAN><I>The 
Beggars Opera </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">(which 
interpolated popular songs into a stable text) did not permit such a 
wide range of musical styles as </SPAN><I>The Black Crook.</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">By 
the time the scores of the American musical as we know it today began 
to emerge in the second and third decades of the 20th century, the 
genre permitted an increasingly wide array of possible styles for 
songs. </SPAN><I>Show Boat </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">could 
therefore include a pastiche of African-American spiritual in “Old 
Man River” and the European-flavored “Life Upon the Wicked 
Stage.” For this reason, it may not be so ridiculous to start the 
story of the American musical with </SPAN><I>Black Crook,</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">after 
all. </SPAN>

<div class="p"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Introduction 
to the variorum edition</B></SPAN>  
</div> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">This edition preserves the five 
extant 19</SPAN><SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">th</SPAN></SUP> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">century copies of the Barras's text: 
a manuscript in Barras's hand (preserved in notebooks held at the 
Harvard Theater Collection), three 19</SPAN><SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">th</SPAN></SUP> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">century manuscript prompt books held 
by the Harvard Theater Collection, New York Public Library, the 
Hampden-Booth Theater Library at the Player's Club, and a published, 
printed edition published in Chicago in 1867 and now held by the 
Library of Congress. It does not include Myron Matlaw's 1967 edition 
(published in his anthology </SPAN><I>The Black Crook and Other 
Nineteenth Century American Plays</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">), 
typescripts of productions performed for the Federal Theater Project 
during the depression, or the two typescripts, seeming created by the 
staff of New York Public Library and later micro-formed as part of 
the Nineteenth Century American Drama series. The NYPL typescripts 
transcribe a copyright date of 1866 and a Buffalo publisher, and so 
may preserve the text of a no longer extant exition, but it seems 
just as likely that these were simply edited transcripts of the 
promptbook still in the collection (which, like the other 19</SPAN><SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">th</SPAN></SUP> 
<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">century promptbooks, has the title 
page from the 1866 Buffalo edition pasted onto its first pages).  </SPAN> 
</div> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">This digital edition also 
excludes any copies of the London libretto which has nothing but the 
title in common with Charles Barras's play.</SPAN></div> 
<div class="p">Of the versions 
included in this variorum edition, The Harvard Theater Collection 
manuscript is likely the earliest. Barras dated the text “1862” 
on the title page, but the “2” appears to have been written over 
an earlier number, leading Craig Bowley<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote15anc" HREF="#sdfootnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A> 
to propose in his 1975 master's thesis that Barras may have backdated 
the piece to avoid accusations of plagiarizing other similar works. 
Instructions to “return to Mr. Barras” are written on the front 
the start of each folio, and manuscript emendations to the text 
suggest edits in the manuscript were made during reheasrals (e.g. 
references to a bridge in the first scene are struck, likely as 
result of a set design that differed slightly from the one Barras 
initially imagined). The second earliest copy is probably also held 
by Harvard, and seems to represent a prompt book for the original 
production (it includes, among the end papers, a receipt for $100 
paid by Charles Barras to John Holloway and dated October 2, 1866 for 
“composing + arranging orchestra parts for “The Black Crook”). 
The prompt copy held by NYPL is also likely an early one produced by 
the same copyist who produced the Harvard prompt copy (the 
handwriting and paper are very similar in both). The prompt copy at 
the Hampden-Booth Theater library may also have been produced by the 
same copyist, but appears to have been used in an 1867 tour of the 
Midwest (there are scene timings for an July 24, 1867 stop at the 
Metropolitan Theater in Indianapolis and a signature by a prompter, 
P.C. Nagen who used the book in Chicago in 1869. As noted above, all 
three promptbooks have pasted onto their first page a printed copy of 
the copyright notice and title page from the no-longer-extant 1866 
Buffalo printing (which may have predated the production at Niblos). 
This title page resembles the typeface and format of the Chicago 
edition so closely as to suggest that the Chicago edition was 
essentially a reprint of the Buffalo version with the cuts made for 
the various productions excised.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote16anc" HREF="#sdfootnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">This digital edition also 
features new recordings and sheet music for eight pieces of music

 Note though, that, with the exception of </SPAN><I>You Naughty, 
Naughty Men,</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">none of these 
pieces likely represent anything like the piano-vocal score used in 
the production. They are, rather, short arrangements to be played at 
home featuring some of the melodies audience may have heard during 
the original production. </SPAN><I>The Black Crook Waltz</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">, 
for instance, includes four sections: “The Power of Love” (an 
excerpt from an aria from Balfe's opera </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Satanella) 
and pieces labeled “Bonfanti”, “Sangalli”, and “Betty 
Regal” (three of the principal dancers in the original production). 
 Each of these</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> are likely 
just a brief excerpts of the full dance melody which is now lost.  
Any attempt to place the rest of the published pieces into the action 
of the play is mostly guess work, but I have tried to find moments 
where the music fits the spirit of the moment. My rationale for the 
placement, admittedly very hypothetical in some cases, for each 
placement is below.</SPAN></div>

later productions used a galop for the demon dance in Stalacta's 
grotto, it seems possible this Thomas Baker's Galop was used earlier. 
David Costa is credited with the “Pas De Demon” on the program, 
and although he is usually credited on sheet music for pieces with 
which he was connected, he is not mentioned on the published music 
for The Black Crook Galop. Further he is not mentioned on the program 
in connection with the Pas De Sabot (or a “Dance of the Wooden 
Shoes”). The pounding rhythm of this Galop suggests it might fit a 
“Pas De Sabot.” Further, it is almost possible to set the lyrics 
of the Villagers chorus (“Hark! Hark! Hark!”) to this music if 
the lyric “Hark the birds with tuneful voices” begins on the 
fifth measure. In the program the “Pas de Sabot” is listed before 
the “Pas De Fleurs” (which would put it too early for the 
Villager's chorus). However, it seems possible that it accompanied 
the Villagers' entrance and then was reprised with lyrics on their 
exit. It is also suggestive, though by no means conclusive proof of a 
change from the order in the program, that the New York Times critic 
mentions the Pas de Sabot after the Pas de Fleur in his synopsis of 
the play.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A>

<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">The 
name of the Transformation Polka suggests that it was used in the 
transformation scene in the fourth act. Prior to the actual 
transformation, though, the stage directions mention that the Amazons 
perform a “characteristic march.” Perhaps this was the Fairy 
Queen March.</SPAN></SPAN>
