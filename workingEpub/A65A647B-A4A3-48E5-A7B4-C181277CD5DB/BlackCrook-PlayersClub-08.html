Eh! what!  madam Barbara, stirring so early?  Why, bless my

Nothing! To begin with, do you call such a storm as that of 
last night nothing?  Why, the thunder creashed over the castle 
loud enough to wake the dead.  That was bad enough, but only 
to think that I, the right honorable foster-mother that <em id="idp595664">is</em> 
to be, to her right honorable ladyship that <em id="idp596096">is</em> to be, passing 
the night in apartments overlooking a dog-kennel!

Aye, a kennel of great, savage hounds, 
fed late at night with 
raw meat by their one-eyed keeper on purpose to give them the night-mare, 
and make them 
dream all night long of chasing wild boars in the forest.  
Ugh!  I shall never get their horrible yelping out of my head.

Believe me, my dear Madam Barbara, it is the first time the 
brutes were ever known to have been unruly.  I promise you that 
they shall be soundly punished and instantly removed.  But 
I, too, am criminal.  The apartments were selected by me because 
they commanded the best view of the mountain.

But I don't want to look at the mountain.  I got a glimpse 
of it from one of the north windows last night, during the
storm, and it looked for all the world as if Belzebub and his 
imps were holding a jubileee there.

be removed.
