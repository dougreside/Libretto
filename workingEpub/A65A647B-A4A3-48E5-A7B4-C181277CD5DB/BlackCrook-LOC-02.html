SCENE I--	A quiet valley at the foot of 
the Hartz Mountains ;   Cottage of Dame Barbara, 
R. H.  3rd Ent., with practicable upper window  
and balcony ; Set tree beside cottages, at back  
Set arbor L.H.  3rd ent. Broken water and  
low rustic stone bridge or long  tail 
piece, with platform from R to L backed  
by an extended range of hills or mountain spurs, 
above which light clouds appear,  
illuminated by the reflected light  
of the moon.  Shortly after rise of curtain the moonbeams grow faint and the ruddy  
glow of the rising sun diffuses itself over the clouds and horizon.  
MUSIC. At rise of curtain--enter  
Rodolphe at back R. H., he descends, comes  
forward and after looking cautiously  
around claps his hands three times beneath  
the window and conceals himself in the arbor.  The upper window opens  
and Amina appears on balcony.

Ill fortune, Amina.  After reaching Gottingen, 
and finding no purchaser for my picture,  
I heard that there was a wealthy traveller  
at Cassel, collecting works of art.   
I had but four silver florins in my  
pocket, yet I hopefully set out to meet  
him.  After journeying five whole days  
I arrived at Cassel, only to find that the  
traveller had departed two days before.

<div class="p" id="idp61952"> 
No; crushed in my last hope to obtain  
the means necessary to our union, I  
left it with a remorseless agent for a  
pittance barely sufficient for subsistence  
during my journey homeward, and here  
I am, without a single guilder in my pocket, and what is worse, if I fail to redeem  
my pledge at the end of two months it  
is lost to me forever.</div>

Be calm and Listen.  Last week I attended  
the festival of St. John in company  
with the other members of the village  
choir, upon raising my eyes, after we  
had finished the anthem, I found a  
dark, strange man gazing upon me;   
a moment after he quitted the spot.  
I inquired who he was and learned that  
it was the Count Wolfenstein, the all 
powerful lord of this wide domain.</div>
