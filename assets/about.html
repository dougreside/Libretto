<h2>About LIBRETTO</h2>
<p>
Libretto is a prototype of an ebook reader capable of reading 
and comparing texts that exist in multiple versions and which 
are part of a work that also important encompasses non-textual 
components (such as music).  Developed by New York Public Library&#39;s 
Digital Curator for the Performing Arts, Doug Reside and funded by a generous 
grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, this app suggests 
a possible future for critical editions of multimodal texts such as 
opera and musical theater
  </p> 
  <p>
  This working prototype is compiled from open source code available under an MIT License

 <br/>
    <p>
 This prototype is subscribed to a feed (generated from a Google Spreadsheet) which may occasionally 
 update the library with additional titles that you may chose to download or ignore.  By default, 
 it includes a copy of a draft of a new variorum edition of <emph>The Black Crook</emph>, an 1866 
 melodrama that early popular theater historians have occasionally (and with little reason) called 
 the &quot;First American Musical.&quot;   
 </p>
 <h2>How to use</h2>

 <ul>
 <li><strong>Navigate through scenes</strong> by clicking the Next and Previous icons at the bottom of the page.</li>
 <li><strong>Navigate from the Introduction and through different versions</strong> of the text by swiping right or left.  The text should automatically stay fairly closely synched.</li>
 <li>When you encounter a speaker icon [ <img src="file:///android_asset/play.jpg"> ], tap it to <strong>listen to the music</strong> associated with that moment in the text.</li>
 <li><strong>To change the audio</strong> associated with a moment, tap the eighth note icon while the music is playing and then tap &quot;Select Audio&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 Eventually, some titles released to the app may not bundle the music with the text
 (perhaps because an editor was able to obtain the rights to distribute the text but not 
 a recording).  When this is the case, you will be prompted to &quot;Select Audio&quot;. 
 You can then attach any music stored on your device.</p>
